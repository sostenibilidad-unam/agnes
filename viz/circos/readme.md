Nodes in the network are the outmost segments among the circumference,
ribbons show connections. Green nodes represent actions, ribbons have
the color of their source node which always represents a person, there
are no green ribbons because actions are always a target. An inner
ring, after the source nodes, shows segments of the same color of the
node at the other end of the connected ribbon. Ticks show node degree of
connectedness.

There is growth in the network from t0 to t1 which can be seen in the
increase of nodes and edges. However the average number of neighbors
decreases, which means that although there are more nodes, there
aren't many new connections. This is also why network density
decreases.

However, the out degree centrality of certain nodes has increased.
