# Agency Network Serializer

## Introduction

Agency Network Analylses map the social action arena of people by
situating them relative to their collaborators and within their
problem space. This helps actors identify where they have agency in
the system, i.e. over what elements and through what relationships.

This mapping is done via a multi-part interview process during which
data is gathered about actors (their context, worplaces, type of
organization, etc.), their activities (practices, capacities), and
their relationships to other actors.

AgNeS is a database administration interface specifically designed to
easily and sistematically gather data for agency network analyses.
Once data is loaded into an ANA database, network structure metrics
can be computed, it can be visualized in several ways or exported to
common standard formats for further processing with other software.


## Database Architecture

![table scheme](../tables.png)

### Data about people

 - Sector (academia, ngo, etc.)
 - Organization (government body, ) 
 - collaborators, relationships
 - practices-actions, capacities
	
### Data about the perception-understanding of a system 

 - Biophysical and socio-political variables

## Networks in an ANA
 
### Agency networks
	Visualizations
	 - hiveplot
	
### Social network (person, person)


### Power network (avatar, power)

 
### Cognitive maps (variable, variable)

They are abstractions or internal representations of how a system works.

Examples: 

a) Cognitive Map of an academic

Here a picture of a cognitive map of the perception of
management and state of a natural protected area of the university
(with socio-political & biophysical variables)

b) Agency Network of a Laboratory that studies the Natural Protected Area-NPA (5 egos, each with 3-4 alters)
