# Introduction

What type of data we are talking about
Why networks (how we retrieve them from Semi-Structured Interviews -SSI); examples;
why a platform to enter data and systematize it]
	
## Data types in a system under study

with a participatory research approach.

### Data about people

 - Sector (academia, ngo, etc.)
 - Organization (government body, ) 
 - collaborators, relationships
 - practices-actions, capacities
 
	
### Data about the perception-understanding of a system 

 - Biophysical and socio-political variables

# Networks (what are they, why to use them for that type of data, etc)

## Social networks -> in particular, agency networks (Ego-nets, Action-nets, Power-nets), objective
	
## Cogntive maps -> as abstractions or internal representations of how a system works .... , objective

Examples: 

a) Cognitive Map of an academic
 Show a picture of a 1-2 cognitive map(s) of the percetion of management and state of a natural protected area of the university (with socio-political & biophysical variables)
    
 b) Agency Network of a Laboratory that studies the Natural Protected Area-NPA (5 egos, each with 3-4 alters)
	Show a picture of how they look after a SSI - what data they show
		Egos: 
	    1. Dr. Nigel (anthropologist)
	    2. MSc. Mischa (Lab Tech)
	    3. Dr. Sandra (biologist)
	    4. Ms. Mirna, (sustainability student)
	    5. Mr. Jared (CEO of an environmental NGO)
		Alters:
	    EGO1: MSc. Mischa, Mr. Jared, Dr. Repsa (head of the NPA)
	    EGO2: Dr. Nigel, Dr. Sandra, Ms. Mirna
	    EGO3: Ms. Mirna, Mr. Admin (permits for NPA), Dr. X (ecologist), Mr. Bugs (student)
	    EGO4: Ms. Tutsi (user), Dr. Sandra
	    EGO5: Dr. Nigel, Dr. Repsa, Mr. Green (International NGO), Mr. Admin, .... ??

4. Use AgNeS as a central database to aid in the collection and curation of data.

## Social network (person, person)


## Power network (avatar, power)

 
## Cognitive maps (variable, variable)
